

Tests Completed :





Issue Found :

1) While Regex is ON , If multiple patterns are given , no match is found . 

2) If searching multiple pattern , results will get repeated if one cell match more than one pattern . Mo point of having multiple results . We just need one instance . So a solution can be removing duplicates by making a set and then a list . 

Prob : Have to make a set of every thing and that will remove the file name list to  just the one name of files .



Changes :

Huge ones . 

1) We are sending a list of search patterns now  . So the parameter passed now is patterlist . 

2) We have engulfed the initial checks (for regular expr etc) now in for loops , looping in patternlist .

In our search module , 

we have compared a cell with all the patterns one by one . If any search is found , its related status is captured and we break out of the loop . 
This help in non-duplication of results . 

It has been tested and its working fine in initial tests .
